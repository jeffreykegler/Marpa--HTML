Marpa::PP::Semantics::Order - How Marpa Ranks Ambiguous Parses

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This document details the order in which
the recognizer's
L<C<value>|Marpa::PP::Recognizer/"value">
method
returns parse results.
The same mechanism allows the selection of parse results.
It can also be exploited to do the actual processing
of parses, using side effects.

=head2 Duplicate Parses are Eliminated

In a single parse series,
Marpa will never return the same parse result twice.
Marpa regards two parses as being the same if they are
B<semantic duplicates>.

Two parses are semantic duplicates if
a recursive, top-down evaluation of each
applies
the same rules
in the same order
at the same earleme locations.
When this is the case,
a deterministic semantics will
always produce the same value for both parses --
hence the term "semantic duplicate".
When the Marpa documentation refers to duplicate
parses, it will mean semantic duplicates unless otherwise
stated.

=head2 Default Parse Order

By calling
the recognizer's
L<C<value>|Marpa::PP::Recognizer/"value">
method
repeatedly,
Marpa can produce all the parse results
for a given parse.
The default is for the parse results to be returned
in an arbitrary order.
This corresponds to the "C<none>" value of
L<the recognizer's C<ranking_method>|Marpa::PP::Recognizer/"ranking_method">
named argument.

=head2 A General Approach to Sorting Parses

The most general way to sort Marpa parses is for the application
to take control.
The application can set up the Marpa semantic actions
so that the value of every parse result is a
C<< <rank, true_value> >> duple.
The duples can then be sorted by C<rank>.
Once the resuls are sorted,
the C<rank> element of the duple can be discarded.
(Those familiar with the Schwartzian transform
may note a resemblance.
In Perl,
duples can be implemented as references to arrays of 2 elements.)

The user needs to be careful.
In theory, ambiguity can cause an exponential explosion in the number of results.
In practice, ambiguity tends to get out of hand very easily.
Producing and sorting all the parses can take a very
long time.

=head2 The Constant Ranking Method

In the past,
Marpa supported a method of sorting parses,
called the Constant Ranking Method.
The Constant Ranking Method is now severely
deprecated.
It is unsupported
and its documentation has been removed.
