=head1 OVERVIEW

Marpa's semantics is of two kinds:

=over

=item * The value semantics.
This is the semantics which produces the value of the parse tree.

=item * The ranking semantics, which is used
to rank ambiguous parse results, but which can be exploited for
its side effects.

=back

=head2 Value Semantics

Marpa's value semantics will be
familiar
to those who have used traditional
methods to evaluate parses.
A parse is seen as a parse tree.
Nodes on the tree are evaluated recursively, bottom-up.
Once the values of all its child nodes are known,
a parent node is ready to be evaluated.
The value of a parse is the value of the top node 
of the parse tree.

Marpa's semantics operate on the application's
original rules and symbols.
The internals of the parser are hidden from
the semantics.
Nodes in Marpa's virtual parse trees are of three kinds:

=over

=item * Token Nodes, which have a constant semantics,
initialized when the token is read.

=item * Rule Nodes, which have a dynamic semantics,
based on action names and actions, as described below.

=item * Null Nodes, which have a constant semantics,
initialized when the recognizer is created.

=back

=head2 Action Names and Actions

When a Marpa grammar is created,
much of its value semantics and ranking semantics
is 
specified indirectly, as B<action names>.
Marpa does not allow semantics to be 
specified directly as Perl closures
until the evaluation phase.
This approach to semantics
follows Perl 6.
I discovered the wisdom of having an additonal layer
of abstraction
the hard way.

To implement its semantics of action names and
actions,
Marpa must do three things:

=over

=item * Determine the action name.

=item * Resolve the action name to an action.
An action is a Perl closure.

=item * Call the Perl closure to produce the
actual result.

=back

The action names and actions used to produce the
node value are called
B<value action names> and
B<value actions>.
The action names and actions used to rank nodes
are called
B<ranking action names> and
B<ranking actions>.

An action name
and action is also used
to create the per-parse variable,
as L<described
below|/"THE PER-PARSE VARIABLE">.
The per-parse variable is a special case,
but it is intended to be used as part of
the value semantics.

=head1 NODES

=head2 Token Nodes

For every input token, there is an associated B<token node>.
In the default model of input,
every token will become a leaf node
in the parse tree.
Tokens always have a B<token symbol>.
At lexing time,
they can be assigned a B<token value>.
If no token value is assigned at lex time,
the token value defaults to a Perl C<undef>.

=head2 Rule Nodes

Nodes which are ancestors of token nodes
are called B<rule nodes>.
Rule nodes are always
associated with a rule.
The value of a rule node is computed at
L<Node Evaluation Time|/"Node Evaluation Time">.
Applications can specify,
on a per-rule basis,
Perl closures to evaluate rule nodes.
The Perl closures which produce the value of
rule nodes are called value actions.

A value action's
arguments will be a
per-parse variable followed by
the values of its child nodes in lexical order.
The return value of a value action becomes the
value of the node.
A value action is always evaluated in scalar context.
If there is no value action for a
rule node,
the value of the rule node is
a Perl C<undef>.

=head2 Sequence Rule Nodes

Some rules are L<sequence rules|Marpa::PP::Grammar/"Sequence Rules">.
Sequence rule nodes are also rule nodes.
Everything said above about rule nodes
applies to sequence rule nodes.
Specifically,
the arguments to the value actions for sequence rules
are the 
per-parse variable followed by
the values of the child nodes in lexical order.

The difference (and it is a big one)
is that in an ordinary rule, the right hand side
is fixed in length, and that length is known
when you are writing the code for the value action.
In a sequence rule,
the number of right hand side symbols is not known
until node evaluation time.
The value action
of a sequence rule node
must be a Perl closure capable of
dealing with
a variable number of arguments.

Sequence semantics work best when
every child node
in the sequence has the same semantics.
When that is not the case,
writing the sequence using
ordinary non-sequence rules should be considered as
an alternative.

By default, if a sequence rule has separators,
the separators are thrown away before
the value action is called.
This means that separators do not appear in the C<@_> array
of the Perl closure which is the value action.
If the value of the C<keep> rule property
is a Perl true value, separators are kept,
and do appear in the
value action's
C<@_> array.

=head2 Null Nodes

A B<null node> is a node which derives the zero-length,
or empty string.
By default, the value of a null node is a Perl C<undef>.
This is adequate for many applications, but Marpa
allows other values to be specified for null nodes.
In fact, Marpa allows
allows an arbitrarily complex null semantics.
Readers interested in null nodes with values
other than C<undef>,
or who simply would like
to read a more detailed account of how Marpa's
null semantics works,
should turn to L<the document on
null semantics|Marpa::PP::Semantics::Null>.

=head1 OVERVIEW OF THE SEMANTIC PHASES

Most applications will find that the order in which
Marpa executes its semantics "just works".
This section describes that order in detail.
These details can matter in some applications,
for example, those which exploit side effects.

=head2 Evaluations, Parse Results and Parse Series

When the semantics are applied to a parse,
it produces a value called a B<parse result>.
Because Marpa allows ambiguous parsing,
each parse can have zero or more parse results.
A B<parse series> is the series of zero or more parse results
for a single B<evaluation>.
The first call to the 
L<the recognizer's C<value>
method|Marpa::PP::Recognizer/"value">
after the recognizer is created is the
start of the first parse series.
The first parse series continues until there is
a call to the
L<the C<reset_evaluation>
method|Marpa::PP::Recognizer/"reset_evaluation">
or until the recognizer is destroyed.
Usually, an application is only interested in a single
parse series.

When the
L<C<reset_evaluation>|Marpa::PP::Recognizer/"reset_evaluation">
method
is called
for a recognizer, it begins a new parse series.
The new parse series continues until
there is another
call to the
L<the C<reset_evaluation>
method|Marpa::PP::Recognizer/"reset_evaluation">,
or until the recognizer is destroyed.

=head2 Summary of the Phases

While processing a recognizer, we have

=over 

=item * A Recognizer Setup Phase, followed by

=item * the processing of zero or more parse series.

=back

While processing a parse series, we have:

=over

=item * A Series Setup Phase, followed by

=item * an optional Ranking Phase, followed by

=item * the processing of zero or more parse results.

=back

While processing a parse result, we have:

=over

=item * A Result Setup Phase, followed by

=item * a Tree Traveral Phase.

=back

Within the Tree Traversal Phase, from the point of view of
each rule node, we have Node Evaluation Time.

=head1 THE SEMANTIC PHASES IN DETAIL

=head2 Recognizer Setup Phase

In the Recognizer Setup Phase, the null values
of the symbols are determined.
The null values of symbols never change --
they are in effect properties of the grammar.

Exactly one Recognizer Setup Phase occurs for every
recognizer.
For every Marpa Recognizer object,
the Recognizer Setup Phase occurs
before any Series Setup Phase.

=head2 Series Setup Phase

During the Series Setup Phase
all value action names are resolved to Perl closures --
the value actions.
The value actions are never called in the Series Setup Phase.
Value actions are called
in the Tree Traversal Phase.

Exactly one Series Setup Phase occurs for each parse
series.
A Series Setup Phase occurs in the first call of
the recognizer's
L<C<value>|Marpa::PP::Recognizer/"value">
method of each parse series.

=head2 Ranking Phase

In the Ranking Phase, all ranking action
names are resolved to Perl
closures (ranking actions),
and those ranking actions are called.
The entire ranking semantics is carried
out in the Ranking Phase.
The Ranking Phase is
the only phase in which ranking action names are
resolved and the only phase
in which ranking actions are called.

Ranking Phases do not occur if
recognizer's L<ranking_method|Marpa::PP::Recognizer/"ranking_method">
is "C<none>", which is the default.
If the recognizer's
ranking method is set to a value other than "C<none>",
a Ranking Phase occurs during the first call
of the recognizer's
L<C<value>|Marpa::PP::Recognizer/"value">
method for
each parse series.

=head2 Result Setup Phase

In the Result Setup Phase,
the per-parse variable is created.
If a constructor was found for the C<action_object>,
it is run at this point, and the per-parse variable is
its return value.
Exactly one Result Setup Phase occurs
for each parse result.

In every parse series,
all the Result Setup Phases occur
after the Series Setup Phase.
In every parse series which has a Ranking Phase,
all the Result Setup Phases occur
after the Ranking Phase.
For each parse result,
the Result Setup Phase occurs before
its Tree Traversal Phase.

=head2 Tree Traversal Phase

During the Tree Traversal Phase,
the semantic Perl closures are called.
For each parse result,
there is exactly one
Tree Traversal Phase,
which follows the Result Setup Phase.

During parse tree traversal, Node Evaluation Time occurs
for every node in the parse.
Tree Traversal Phases
occur during
calls of the recognizer's
C<value> method.

=head2 Node Evaluation Time

Node Evaluation Time is not really a separate
phase.
Node Evaluation Time is the Tree Traversal Phase,
seen from the point of view of the individual nodes of the parse tree.
If a node has a semantic Perl closure,
it is called at Node Evaluation Time.

=head1 FINDING THE ACTION FOR A RULE

Marpa finds the action for each rule based on
rule and symbol properties and on the grammar named arguments.
Specifically, Marpa attempts the following,
in order:

=over

=item * Resolving an action based on the C<action> property of the rule,
if one is defined.

=item * Resolving an action based on the C<lhs> property of the rule.

=item * Resolving an action based on
the C<default_action> named argument of the grammar,
if one is defined.

=item * Defaulting to a virtual action which
returns a Perl C<undef>.

=back

Resolution of action names is L<described
below|/"RESOLVING ACTION NAMES">.
If the C<action> property
or the C<default_action> named argument is defined,
but does not resolve successfully, Marpa
throws an exception.
Marpa prefers to "fast fail" in these cases,
because they often indicate a mistake in
writing the application.

=head1 RESOLVING ACTION NAMES

Action names come from these sources:

=over

=item * The C<default_action> named argument of Marpa's grammar.

=item * The C<action> property of Marpa's rules.

=item * The C<ranking_action> property of Marpa's rules.

=item * The C<new> constructor in the package specified by the
C<action_object> named argument of the Marpa grammar.

=item * The C<lhs> property of Marpa's rules.

=back

=head2 Explicit Resolution

The recognizer's C<closures> named argument
allows the user to directly control the mapping from action names
to actions.
The value of the C<closures> named argument
is a reference to a hash whose keys are
action names and whose hash values are CODE refs.

If an action name is the key of an entry in the C<closures> hash,
it resolves to the closure referenced by the value part of that hash entry.
Resolution via the C<closures> named argument is
called B<explicit resolution>.

When explicit resolution is the only kind of resolution that is wanted,
it is best to pick a name that is very unlikely to be the name
of a Perl closure.
Many of
L<Marpa::HTML>'s action names
are intended for explicit resolution only.
In L<Marpa::HTML> those action names
begin with
an exclamation mark ("!"),
and that convention is recommended.

=head2 Fully Qualified Action Names

If explicit resolution fails, 
Marpa transforms the action name into a
B<fully qualified> Perl name.
An action name that
contains a double colon ("C<::>") or a single quote ("C<'>")
is considered to be a fully qualified name.
Any other action name is considered to be a B<bare action name>.

If the action name to be resolved is already a fully qualified name,
it is not further transformed.
It will be resolved in the form it was received,
or not at all.

For bare action names,
Marpa tries to qualify them by adding a package name.
If the C<actions> grammar named argument is defined,
Marpa uses it as the package name.
Otherwise,
if the
C<action_object> grammar named argument is defined,
Marpa uses it as the package name.
Once Marpa has fully qualified the action name,
Marpa looks for a Perl closure with that name.

Marpa will not attempt to resolve an action name
that it cannot fully qualify.
This implies that,
for an action name to resolve successfully,
one of these four things must be the case:

=over

=item * The action name resolves explicitly.

=item * The action name is fully qualified to begin with.

=item * The C<actions> named argument is defined.

=item * The C<action_object> named argument is defined.

=back

In all but one circumstance,
failure to resolve an action name
is thrown as an exception.
Marpa is more lenient
when a rule attempts to use
the C<lhs> rule property as an action name.
That is the
one case in which Marpa
will look at other alternatives.

Marpa's philosophy 
asks the programmer to be specific about action names.
This can be an inconvenience, but Marpa prefers this to
silently executing unintended code.

Generally it is a good practice to keep
the semantic Perl closures
in their own namespace.
But if, for example, the user wants to leave the
semantic closures in the C<main> namespace,
she can specify
C<"main">
as the value of the C<actions> named argument.

=head1 THE PER-PARSE VARIABLE

In the Result Setup Phase,
Marpa creates a per-parse variable.
This becomes the first argument of the semantic Perl closures for
the rule nodes.
If the grammar's C<action_object> named argument is not defined,
the per-parse variable is initialized to an empty hash ref.

Most data for
the value actions of the rules
will be passed up the parse tree.
The actions will see the values of the rule node's child nodes
as arguments,
and will return their own value to be seen as an argument
by their parent node.
The per-parse variable can be used for data which does not
conveniently fit this model.

The lifetime of the per-parse variable
extends into the Tree Traversal Phase.
During the Tree Traversal Phase,
Marpa's internals never alter the per-parse variable --
it is reserved for use by the application.

=head2 Action Object Constructor

If the grammar's C<action_object> named argument has a defined value,
that value is treated as the name of a class.
The B<action object constructor> is
the C<new> method
in the C<action_object> class.

The action object constructor is called
in the Result Setup Phase.
The return value of the
action object constructor becomes the per-parse variable.
It is a fatal error if the
grammar's C<action_object> named argument is defined,
but does not name a class with a C<new> method.

Resolution of the action object constructor is
resolution of the B<action object constructor name>.
The action object constructor name is
formed by concatenating
the literal string "C<::new>" to
the value of the C<action_object> named argument.

All standard rules apply when resolving the action
object constructor name.
In particular, bypass via
explicit resolution applies to
the action object constructor.
If the action object constructor name is
a hash key in the
evaluator's C<closures> named argument,
then 
the Perl closure referred to by 
the value of that hash entry becomes the
action object constructor.

If a grammar has both the C<action> and the 
C<action_object> named arguments defined,
all action names B<except>
for the action object constructor will be
resolved in the C<action> package or not at all.
The action object constructor is always in
the C<action_object> class, if it is anywhere.

=head1 PARSE ORDER

If a parse is ambiguous, all parses are returned,
with no duplication.
By default, the order is arbitrary, but
it is also possible to control the order.
Details are in L<the document
on parse order|Marpa::PP::Semantics::Order>.

=head1 CONTEXT-AWARE STATIC METHODS

=for Marpa::PP::Display
name: Marpa::PP::token_location example
perltidy: '-dcsc -sil=0'

    sub rank_null_a {
        return \( ( $MyTest::MAXIMAL ? -1 : 1 )
            * 10**( 3 - Marpa::PP::token_location() ) );
    }

=for Marpa::PP::Display::End

Ranking Perl closures
have
available a set of B<context-aware static methods>.
A ranking action can use these methods to learn
about the context in which it is called.
As of this writing, the context-aware
static methods are available for the
ranking actions only.
This may change in the future.

=head2 Marpa::PP::location

Returns the location of the origin (or start) of the rule.

=head2 Marpa::PP::token_location

Returns the location of the token.
Intended for use in callbacks
associated with empty rules and nulling symbols.

=head1 INFINITE LOOPS

Marpa allows grammars with infinite loops.
These are universally considered useless in practical applications.
Marpa supports all the semantics for these that should be necessary
and more.
Because it can handle
infinite loops, Marpa can accurately
claim to support B<every grammar> that can be written in BNF.

Marpa applies semantics to infinite loops by breaking the loop at
some convenient point, so that an infinite regress is prevented.
The exact location at which the loop is broken
varies among Marpa implementations.
If an infinite loop is given a null semantics, which is the default,
the location of the break will not matter.

More could be done.
In particular, a precise definition of where loops are broken
would allow applications to depend on the details of the structure
of infinite loops.
But practical interest in this seems non-existent.
For those who want to know more,
the details are in a L<separate
document|Marpa::PP::Semantics::Infinite>.
