For Marpa::HTML:
* Eliminate use of Marpa namespace for invoking Marpa::XS, Marpa::PP once
official releases of these bless objects into their own namespace.
Make sure I require versions of Marpa::XS, Marpa::PP which have the
necessary blessing behavior.

For Marpa::PP
* Add no_xs.t, no_bare.t
* Restrict use of Marpa namespace
* Add Marpa::PP::DEPRECATED_OK as guard for constant ranking method
* Add deprecated.t, eiliminate tokens, Marpa namespace from all other *.t
 
For Marpa::XS
* Add deprecated.t, eliminate Marpa namespace from all other *.t

For Marpa::PP and Marpa::XS, later
* Add COMPATIBILITY mode, with compatibility.t
* Add COMPATIBILITY to all *.t but deprecated.t
